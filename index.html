        <h3>1. Thesis Project - Unity Game</h3>
        <p>In my thesis project, I developed a Unity game focused on creating an immersive and interactive storytelling experience. The primary goal was to design an interface that captivates users and allows them to engage with the narrative in a unique way.<br>
          I created an environment where players can explore a rich storyline, make choices that influence the plot, and experience dynamic storytelling elements. The interface seamlessly integrates various interactive elements such as dialogue systems, character interactions, and environmental cues to enhance the overall narrative experience.
        <br>
        By playing this game, players not only engage with an immersive interface but also gain a deep understanding of the story.

                <p>
                  Apart from being a web developer, I thoroughly enjoy spending my time outdoors, particularly playing club cricket as it is one of my favorite hobbies. When circumstances keep me indoors, I indulge in my passion for sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows. 
                    <br>
                  Additionally, I am an aspiring chef, and I often devote a significant portion of my free time to experimenting with new recipes. Furthermore, I keep myself up-to-date with the latest technology advancements within the community, continuously exploring and learning about the ever-evolving world of technology.
